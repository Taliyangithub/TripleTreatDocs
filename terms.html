    </div>

    <h2>1. Who provides the Service</h2>

    </p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is intended for business/kitchen management. You must be legally able to enter into these Terms
      and comply with all applicable laws.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Accounts and authentication</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials.</li>
      <li>You must provide accurate information (including a valid email address).</li>
      <li>Some actions (such as creating or joining kitchens) may require email verification.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Kitchens, roles, and access</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The Service allows users to create or join kitchens using a kitchen identifier.</li>
      <li>Roles include <strong>owner</strong> and <strong>staff</strong>, with different permissions.</li>
      <li>Kitchen owners manage staff membership, including approving or rejecting join requests.</li>
      <li>You must not attempt to access kitchens or data you are not authorized to access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Your content and operational data</h2>
    <p>
      You are responsible for the data you input into the Service (including orders, menu items, inventory, and staff actions).
      You represent that you have the right to use and share that data and that it does not violate any law or third-party rights.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Acceptable use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>

      We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data export and account deletion</h2>
    <ul>

      <li>You can request account deletion in-app.</li>
      <li>
        If you are the only owner of a kitchen, deleting your account may also delete the kitchen and its associated data.
        If other owners exist, your membership may be removed while the kitchen remains.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Fees</h2>
    <p>
      Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the Service is provided without fees. If we introduce paid features,
      we will provide clear notice and any additional terms before you are charged.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Intellectual property</h2>
    <p>
      The Service, including its design and software, is owned by the Triple Treat Project Team or its licensors and is protected
      by applicable intellectual property laws. You receive a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Service
      for its intended purpose, subject to these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Third-party services</h2>
    <p>
      The Service relies on third-party providers (for example, Firebase for authentication and database services).

    <h2>12. Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied,

    </p>

    <h2>14. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable
      attorneys' fees) arising out of your use of the Service or violation of these Terms.
    </p>
