      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Triple Treat</strong> ("we", "us") collects, uses, shares, and protects
        information when you use our iOS application and related services (the "Service").
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have questions, contact us at one of the emails listed in the <a href="#contact">Contact</a> section.
      </p>

    <h2>1. What the Service does</h2>
    <p>
      Triple Treat is a kitchen/restaurant management app that helps a kitchen team manage orders, menu items,
      inventory, staff access, and basic analytics. The Service supports creating or joining kitchens and
      role-based access (owner/staff), including join requests and approvals.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Account information</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Email address (for login, verification, password reset, and account management).</li>
      <li>Display name (optional, if you provide it).</li>
      <li>Account timestamps (e.g., createdAt, lastSignIn).</li>
      <li>Email verification status.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Kitchen and operational data you create</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Kitchens you create or join (kitchenId, kitchen name, ownerId, createdAt).</li>
      <li>Kitchen membership data (role: owner/staff; status: pending/approved/rejected; approvedAt where applicable).</li>
      <li>Orders (order number, business date, items, status, order type, table number if used, timestamps).</li>
      <li>Menu items (name, category, price, description, availability, icon).</li>
      <li>Inventory items (name, quantity, unit, expiry date, icon, timestamps as stored).</li>
      <li>Kitchen settings (currency, categories, business-day cutoff hour).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.3 Device and usage information</h3>
    <p>
      We do not intentionally collect precise location data. We may receive basic device/technical information
      needed to operate and secure the Service (for example through platform logs or Firebase telemetry),
      such as app version, timestamps, and error reports, depending on your device and Firebase configuration.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How we use information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To authenticate you and manage your account (sign up, login, email verification, password reset).</li>
      <li>To provide core functionality (kitchen access, orders, menu, inventory, staff management, analytics).</li>
      <li>To maintain security and prevent abuse (role-based access, join-request moderation, integrity checks).</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Legal bases (EEA/UK/Switzerland users)</h2>
    <p>If applicable, we process personal data under the following legal bases:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Contract</strong>: to provide the Service you request.</li>
      <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong>: to secure and improve the Service and prevent misuse.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal obligation</strong>: where required to comply with laws.</li>
      <li><strong>Consent</strong>: where we ask for it (for example, optional features you enable).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Sharing of information</h2>
    <p>We share information only as needed to operate the Service:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Service providers</strong>:
        We use Google Firebase services (e.g., Firebase Authentication and Firebase Realtime Database) to store and process
        data and provide authentication. Firebase may process data according to its terms and privacy practices.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Within your kitchen</strong>:
        Data you enter in a kitchen (orders, menu, inventory, staff list) is visible to other approved members of that kitchen
        according to their role and permissions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal and safety</strong>:
        We may disclose information if required by law, to respond to lawful requests, or to protect rights, safety, and security.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Service.
      You can delete your account in-app. Depending on your role, deleting your account may also delete kitchens and their data
      if you are the only owner.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your privacy choices and rights</h2>

    <h3>7.1 Export your data</h3>
    <p>
      The app provides an in-app export feature that generates a machine-readable JSON file of your account-related data
      (such as profile and your kitchen memberships) for download.
    </p>

    <h3>7.2 Delete your account</h3>
    <p>You can request account deletion in-app. When you delete your account:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your user profile record is removed from our database.</li>
      <li>Your authentication account is deleted (subject to platform and security constraints).</li>
      <li>If you are a staff member, your membership references are removed.</li>
      <li>If you are the only owner of a kitchen, that kitchen and its associated data may be deleted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7.3 Access, correction, objection</h3>
    <p>
      Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, or object to processing of your personal data.
      Contact us using one of the emails in the <a href="#contact">Contact</a> section.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information.
      No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Triple Treat is intended for business/kitchen management and is not directed to children.
      We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>10. International transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Our service providers may process data on servers located in different countries.
      Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards for international transfers.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Third-party services</h2>
    <p>
      The Service relies on third-party infrastructure (such as Firebase). Their use of data is governed by their
      own policies and agreements.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will revise the effective date above and, where appropriate,
      provide notice in the app.
